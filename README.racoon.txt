The contents from the text file are stored in a dictionary, some simple analyses are done on some variables (distance travelled by George, average energy level, average location), and then a text file named georges_life.txt is created with results from analysis (distance travelled by George, average energy level, average location, dead or alive) and some data (Date, Time, X and Y coordinates, the Asleep flag, the behavior mode) from the 2008Males0006.txt file.
